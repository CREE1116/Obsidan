## Obtaining Data : Sampling

- Data mining typically deals with huge databases


- For piloting/prototyping, algorithms and models are typically applied to a sample from a database, to produce statistically-vaild results


- Once you develop and select a final model, you use it to "score"(predict values or classes for) the observations in the larger database
